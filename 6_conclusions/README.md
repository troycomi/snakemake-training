# Conclusions

I hope you have an understanding of snakemake and can convert your shell scripts
into reproducible snakefiles.  While we have covered a lot, there are several
advanced topics that are helpful we didn't have time for:
- [Priorities](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html#priorities)
- [Jupyter integration](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html#jupyter-notebook-integration)
- [Protected, temporary, ancient, directory flags](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html#protected-and-temporary-files)
- [Rule dependencies](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html#rule-dependencies)
- [Grouped and piped rules](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html#defining-groups-for-execution)
- [Checkpoints](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html#data-dependent-conditional-execution)
- [Environment Modules](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/deployment.html#using-environment-modules)

I highly recommend reading through the
[rules documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html),
I always learn something new from that page.
